                    <div class="blog-flex"><p>Open source contributions are a great
                        way to improve your coding skills, build your portfolio,
                        and give back to the community. GitHub, the largest
                        platform for open source projects, makes it easy for
                        developers to contribute through pull requests. This
                        blog will guide you through the process of contributing
                        to open source projects on GitHub using pull
                        requests.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h3>Set Up Your GitHub Account</h3>
                            <p>If you don't already have a GitHub account, sign
                                up at <a href="https://github.com"
                                    target="_blank">github.com</a>. Configure
                                your GitHub profile with a profile picture, bio,
                                and any other relevant information.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Find a Project to Contribute To</h3>
                            <p>Explore repositories by browsing the <a
                                    href="https://github.com/explore"
                                    target="_blank">Explore</a> page or
                                searching for topics of interest. Look for
                                repositories with labels like
                                <code>good-first-issue</code> or <code>help
                                    wanted</code> which indicate issues suitable
                                for new contributors.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Fork the Repository</h3>
                            <p>Go to the repository you want to contribute to
                                and click the <strong>Fork</strong> button at
                                the top right corner. This creates a copy of the
                                repository under your GitHub account.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Clone the Repository</h3>
                            <p>Clone the forked repository to your local machine
                                using the following command:</p>
                            <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git</code></pre>
                            <p>Navigate into the repository:</p>
                            <pre><code>cd REPOSITORY-NAME</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Create a New Branch</h3>
                            <p>Create and switch to a new branch for your
                                work:</p>
                            <pre><code>git checkout -b my-feature-branch</code></pre>
                            <p>It's good practice to name your branch something
                                descriptive about the changes you intend to
                                make.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Make Your Changes</h3>
                            <p>Make the necessary changes to the codebase. This
                                could involve fixing bugs, adding features,
                                updating documentation, or improving tests. As
                                you make changes, frequently commit your work
                                with clear and concise commit messages:</p>
                            <pre><code>
git add .
git commit -m "Description of the changes made"
                        </code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Push Your Changes</h3>
                            <p>Push your changes to your forked repository on
                                GitHub:</p>
                            <pre><code>git push origin my-feature-branch</code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Create a Pull Request</h3>
                            <p>Navigate to the original repository on GitHub and
                                you should see a prompt to create a pull request
                                from your recently pushed branch. Click
                                <strong>Compare & pull request</strong>. Fill
                                out the pull request template, providing a clear
                                title and description of the changes you made,
                                why they are necessary, and any additional
                                context. Submit the pull request by clicking
                                <strong>Create pull request</strong>.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Engage in the Review Process</h3>
                            <p>The maintainers of the project will review your
                                pull request. They might ask for changes or
                                provide feedback. Engage in a constructive
                                manner, make the requested changes, and update
                                your pull request as needed:</p>
                            <pre><code>
git add .
git commit -m "Addressed feedback from maintainers"
git push origin my-feature-branch
                        </code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Merge Your Pull Request</h3>
                            <p>Once your pull request is approved, it will be
                                merged into the main codebase. Some projects
                                allow you to merge it yourself, while others
                                will be merged by the maintainers. Celebrate
                                your contribution to open source!</p>
